# intro-to-nodejs

In backend our server interacts with our database then we execute some code on our server to create an application which then server to the client side. This will speed up your website and also keeps your business logic hidden

The commonly used technologies in the backen

- node js
- ruby
- java
- php

Frameworks for the above technologies

- express js
- ruby on rail
- spring
- cake php
  the main job of these frame work is to simply reduce the repetitive stuff the developer has to do. They save developers work by cutting down the ground work

# Nodejs

## Why node js

- node js runs on javascript
- make us capable of creating scalable and really fast running websites
- it takes js out of the browser, liberates it allowing to interact directly with the hardware of the computer
- we can also use nodejs to run js code in someone else's computer or rather a server
- means, a user can logg on to google and put in a query and the brower will make requst to google servers and on those servers we can actually execute js code to process their request and after that run we can send back the result to the user or to the client and get the web browser to display the information. All the heavy lifting and code execution happens behind the scenes on the server rather than on the client side
- in the comming lessons we are going to be using nodejs to interact directly with the computer inorder to access local files listen to network traffic and manipulate databases

## companies using nodejs

- uber
- ebay
- twitter
- netflix

# command line / how to use node

git bash => pwd => cd Desktop/ => ls => mkdir intro-to-node => cd intro-to-node => ls => touch index.js => code .
=> in the vscode => node index.js

1. create a new folder called intro-to-node in the desktop
2. open it in the vs code
3. create a new file called index.js in the root folder in vs code
4. console log some text in the index.js file
5. open terminal using control+backtick
6. run the file using the command 'node index.js'

# The node REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loops )

By installing node, we also install node reple (read evaluation print loops).
write 'node' inside the terminal and hit enter. Once you see that little angle bracket then you know you are inside the reple
here we can write code directly for eg: console.log("Hi there"), 5\*3, "zareel Kalam" etc

to exit from the terminal hit control + c twice

# How to use the native node module

We can use node js to get access directly to the local files of the computer. One of the built in module for node to help us to do that

## file system module

[nodejs file system](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v19.x/api/fs.html)

create a file called source.text in the root folder

```js
const fs = require("fs");

fs.copyFileSync("source.text", "destination.text");

//node index.js
```

# The npm package manager and installing extarnal node modules
- npm(node package manager) is a package manager for external modules

`npm init`

- index.js

```js

const superheroes = require("superheroes")
const supervillains = require("supervillains")

superheroes.all;
supervillains.all;


const mySuperHero = superheroes.random()
const myVillain  = supervillains.random()


console.log = (`my super hero is ${mySuperHero}`)
console.log(`my favourite villain is ${myVillain}`);
```

## json 
: is simply a file format that we used to organize our data

## Express
: less repetetive code

# Creating our first server with nodejs and express
- create new directory called my express server
- cd into the new directory
- inside create a new file called server.js
- initialize npm with server.js as start point
